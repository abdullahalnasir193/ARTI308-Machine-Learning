# Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems

## 1. Dataset Description
* [cite_start]**Dataset Name**: Global Cars Enhanced [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]**Source**: Uploaded CSV file [cite: 19]
* **Features**: Brand, Manufacture_Year, Fuel_Type, Engine_CC, Horsepower, and Car_Age.

## 2. Machine Learning Problem
* [cite_start]**Problem Type**: **Regression** [cite: 7, 29]
* [cite_start]**Target Variable**: `Price_USD` [cite: 9, 30]
* [cite_start]**Problem Statement**: The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the car price (`Price_USD`) based on numerical features like `Car_Age`, `Horsepower`, and `Engine_CC`[cite: 10, 31, 32].
