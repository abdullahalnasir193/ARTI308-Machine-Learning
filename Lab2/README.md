# Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems

## 1. Dataset Description
* **Dataset Name**: Global Cars Enhanced
* **Source**: Open-source car market data.
* **Key Features**: 
    * `Brand`: The manufacturer of the car.
    * `Horsepower`: The engine power output.
    * `Car_Age`: How many years since the car was manufactured.
    * `Engine_CC`: The engine displacement.

## 2. Machine Learning Problem
* **Problem Type**: Regression
* **Target Variable**: `Price_USD`
* **Problem Statement**: 
The goal of this project is to predict the market price of a car based on its technical specifications and age. Since we are predicting a continuous numerical value (Price), this is a Regression problem.
